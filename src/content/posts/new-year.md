Happy New Year! May 2023 be better than 2022. Hopefully all of the predictions are wrong and we turn a corner for the better.
* That Covid will no longer rule our lives
* That we are no longer in (or don't enter) a resession
* Home prices go back to normal, so we can afford a house and not a tent
* That Soutwest Airlines can finally normalize their flight schedules so I can get to Disneyworld in May

A lot more sarcastic posts coming in 2023!
