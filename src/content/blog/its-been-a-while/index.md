 My last post was in 2022. We are more than a quarter into 2023, so I thought I better write something. So here I am, trying to see if I can do this completely on an iPad.  Safari is the web browser, GitHub.dev is the editor, amd a whole lot of trial and error to get to this point.

 Three big issues so far into this little experiment. 

 1. The actual cursor, where the letters are appearing as I type, are about 8 characters behind where the blinking cursor is. This is making it rather difficult to move around to fix typos.

 2. Starting a new line, the iPad doesnt auto capitalize the first letter in this editor. Maybe it isn't supposed to, but I am pretty sure autocorrect or something in iPhone will do that for me. 

3. Typing on iPad virtual keyboard is annoying. If I end up doing this at all, I would need to invest in some sort of physical keyboard. 

Anywhoo, thats enough to test with, so let's see how we can publish this now.
